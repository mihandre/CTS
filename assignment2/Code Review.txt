Phase 1
-rename loan_value and account_Type to match mixedCamelCase
-refactor line 6 to ENUM
-"double loan()" both prints to console and returns a value; should create two separate functions "void printLoan()" and "double getLoan()"
-same as above for "double getRate()"
-implement interface for "double getMonthlyRate()"
-rename "void setValue()" to "void setLoanValue()", rename parameter
-"void setValue()" should throw specific Exception to facilitate testing and debugging
-change "to_string" to "toString" - common name
-"void print()" does nothing useful; should at least delete the unused "int vb" variable
